# For the Docker environment, Vite's environment variables are set directly in the 'environment' section of the frontend service in docker-compose.yml.
# This ensures they are available during the 'npm run build' step within the Docker container.
# The values used are:
# VITE_API_URL=http://nginx/api
# VITE_WS_URL=ws://nginx/ws
#
# This .env file is therefore not strictly necessary for the Docker build, but it is good practice to keep it.
# It can be used for local development outside of Docker. For example:
#
# VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8080/api
# VITE_WS_URL=ws://localhost:8080/ws
