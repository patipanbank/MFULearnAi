# 2. Requirements

### Functional Requirements (FR)
1. FR1: The system must be rebuilt using the latest versions of React, NestJS, and TypeScript, maintaining all current core features except authentication.
2. FR2: The new architecture must support real-time chat, agent management, knowledge base, and document upload functionalities.
3. FR3: The system must integrate with AWS Bedrock for AI/LLM features and ChromaDB for vector search.
4. FR4: The backend must expose REST and WebSocket APIs for all major modules.
5. FR5: The system must support SAML SSO and JWT for authentication, preserving the existing auth system and its integrations.
6. FR6: The deployment must use Docker Compose and support on-premises or university-managed infrastructure.

### Non-Functional Requirements (NFR)
1. NFR1: The system must be scalable to support increased user load without significant performance degradation.
2. NFR2: The codebase must be modular, maintainable, and follow modern best practices for both frontend and backend.
3. NFR3: The system must maintain or improve current security standards, especially for user data and authentication.
4. NFR4: The system must be compatible with university-managed infrastructure and self-hosted services.
5. NFR5: The system must include comprehensive logging, monitoring, and automated testing (unit, integration, E2E).

### Compatibility Requirements (CR)
1. CR1: Existing API compatibility must be maintained for the authentication system.
2. CR2: Database schema changes must not break existing user or authentication data.
3. CR3: UI/UX consistency must be preserved where possible, with improvements documented.
4. CR4: Integration compatibility with AWS Bedrock, ChromaDB, and university-managed services must be ensured.
