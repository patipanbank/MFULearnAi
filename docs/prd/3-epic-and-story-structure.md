# Brownfield System Rebuild & Modernization - Brownfield Enhancement

## Epic Goal
Rebuild the MFULearnAi platform using modern technologies (React 19, NestJS 10, TypeScript), integrating AWS Bedrock for AI, ChromaDB for vector search, and supporting real-time chat, agent management, knowledge base, and document upload. Ensure compatibility with university-managed infrastructure and maintain/improve all current core features and security standards.

## Epic Description

**Existing System Context:**
- Current relevant functionality: Real-time chat, agent management, knowledge base, document upload, authentication (SAML SSO, JWT)
- Technology stack: React, NestJS, TypeScript, MongoDB, Redis, MinIO, AWS Bedrock, ChromaDB, Docker Compose
- Integration points: REST/WebSocket APIs, Bedrock API, ChromaDB, SAML SSO, university-managed infrastructure

**Enhancement Details:**
- What's being added/changed: Full system rebuild with modern stack, improved modularity, maintainability, and scalability. Integration with AWS Bedrock and ChromaDB. Enhanced real-time and agent features. Improved deployment and monitoring.
- How it integrates: Replaces existing system, preserves API compatibility, integrates with all current data/auth sources, and university-managed infrastructure.
- Success criteria: All PRD requirements met, system deployable on university infra, all core features preserved or improved, security and maintainability enhanced, full documentation and automated tests provided.

## Stories
1. **Story 1:** Rebuild frontend and backend core with new stack, preserving all major features except authentication.
2. **Story 2:** Integrate AWS Bedrock and ChromaDB for AI and vector search, ensuring compatibility and security.
3. **Story 3:** Implement real-time chat, agent management, knowledge base, and document upload with REST/WebSocket APIs and university SSO integration.

## Compatibility Requirements
- [ ] Existing APIs remain unchanged
- [ ] Database schema changes are backward compatible
- [ ] UI changes follow existing patterns
- [ ] Performance impact is minimal

## Risk Mitigation
- **Primary Risk:** Integration with university-managed infrastructure and external Bedrock API may introduce unforeseen issues.
- **Mitigation:** Use modular, well-documented interfaces; maintain backward compatibility; thorough integration testing.
- **Rollback Plan:** Retain current system until new deployment is fully validated; enable rollback to previous version if critical issues arise.

**Story Manager Handoff:**

Please develop detailed user stories for this brownfield epic. Key considerations:

- This is an enhancement to an existing system running React, NestJS, TypeScript, MongoDB, Redis, MinIO, AWS Bedrock, ChromaDB, Docker Compose
- Integration points: REST/WebSocket APIs, Bedrock API, ChromaDB, SAML SSO, university-managed infrastructure
- Existing patterns to follow: Modular monolith, event-driven, microservices-ready, API gateway, CQRS, centralized logging/monitoring
- Critical compatibility requirements: API and data compatibility, security, performance, UI/UX consistency
- Each story must include verification that existing functionality remains intact

The epic should maintain system integrity while delivering the goal of a modernized, maintainable, and scalable MFULearnAi platform.
