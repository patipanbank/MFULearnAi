# Story 1.3: Implement Real-Time Chat, Agent Management, Knowledge Base, and Document Upload

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** platform engineer,
**I want** to implement real-time chat, agent management, knowledge base, and document upload with REST/WebSocket APIs and university SSO integration,
**so that** users can interact with the system in real time, manage agents, access knowledge, and upload documents securely and efficiently.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Real-time chat functionality is implemented and accessible via REST and WebSocket APIs.
2. Agent management features are available and integrated with the backend.
3. Knowledge base functionality is implemented, supporting search and retrieval.
4. Document upload is available and secure.
5. SAML SSO integration is implemented for authentication.
6. All features are compatible with university-managed infrastructure.
7. Comprehensive tests cover all new features and integration points.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Implement real-time chat with REST and WebSocket APIs (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Backend: chat service, controller, and gateway
  - [ ] Frontend: chat UI and integration
- [ ] Implement agent management (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Backend: agent service and controller
  - [ ] Frontend: agent management UI
- [ ] Implement knowledge base (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Backend: collection and search services
  - [ ] Frontend: knowledge base UI
- [ ] Implement document upload (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Backend: upload and document services
  - [ ] Frontend: upload UI
- [ ] Integrate SAML SSO for authentication (AC: 5)
- [ ] Validate compatibility with university infrastructure (AC: 6)
- [ ] Add automated tests for all features (AC: 7)

## Dev Notes
- Source Tree: See backend/chat/, backend/agent/, backend/collection/, backend/upload/, backend/auth/ for relevant modules.
- Use REST and WebSocket APIs as specified in architecture docs.
- SAML SSO integration should preserve existing authentication compatibility.
- Ensure all endpoints are documented in OpenAPI/Swagger.

### Testing
- Test files should be located alongside implementation files (e.g., __tests__ folders or *.spec.ts).
- Use Jest for backend and React Testing Library for frontend.
- Include unit, integration, and E2E tests for all new features.
- Ensure tests cover all acceptance criteria and integration points.
