# Story 1.2: Integrate AWS Bedrock and ChromaDB

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** platform engineer,
**I want** to integrate AWS Bedrock for AI/LLM features and ChromaDB for vector search,
**so that** the system supports advanced AI capabilities and efficient knowledge retrieval while ensuring compatibility and security.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. AWS Bedrock is integrated for AI/LLM features in the backend.
2. ChromaDB is integrated for vector search and knowledge base functionality.
3. All integrations are secure and compatible with university-managed infrastructure.
4. APIs for AI and vector search are exposed and documented.
5. Integration is modular and maintainable.
6. Comprehensive tests cover all new integration points.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Integrate AWS Bedrock API in backend (AC: 1, 3, 4)
  - [ ] Implement secure API access and error handling
  - [ ] Document endpoints and usage
- [ ] Integrate ChromaDB for vector search (AC: 2, 3, 4)
  - [ ] Implement vector storage and retrieval
  - [ ] Document endpoints and usage
- [ ] Ensure modularity and maintainability (AC: 5)
- [ ] Add automated tests for all integration points (AC: 6)
- [ ] Validate compatibility with university infrastructure (AC: 3)

## Dev Notes
- Source Tree: See backend/bedrock/, backend/collection/, and backend/services/chroma.service.ts for integration points.
- Follow modular integration patterns as described in architecture docs.
- Use environment variables for API keys and sensitive configuration.
- Ensure all endpoints are documented in OpenAPI/Swagger.

### Testing
- Test files should be located alongside implementation files (e.g., __tests__ folders or *.spec.ts).
- Use Jest for backend integration tests.
- Include unit and integration tests for all new endpoints and features.
- Ensure tests cover all acceptance criteria and integration points.
