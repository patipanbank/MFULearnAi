# Story 1.1: Rebuild Core Platform

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** platform engineer,
**I want** to rebuild the frontend and backend core with the new stack (React 19, NestJS 10, TypeScript),
**so that** all major features (except authentication) are preserved and modernized for maintainability and scalability.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Frontend and backend are rebuilt using React 19, NestJS 10, and TypeScript.
2. All major features (real-time chat, agent management, knowledge base, document upload) are preserved.
3. Authentication is excluded from this story.
4. APIs (REST and WebSocket) are exposed for all major modules.
5. System is modular, maintainable, and follows modern best practices.
6. Codebase is compatible with university-managed infrastructure.
7. Comprehensive logging, monitoring, and automated tests are included.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Set up new project structure for frontend and backend (AC: 1, 5)
  - [ ] Initialize React 19 app with TypeScript and Zustand
  - [ ] Initialize NestJS 10 backend with TypeScript
- [ ] Implement core modules: chat, agent, knowledge base, document upload (AC: 2, 4)
  - [ ] Migrate or rewrite chat module
  - [ ] Migrate or rewrite agent management module
  - [ ] Migrate or rewrite knowledge base module
  - [ ] Migrate or rewrite document upload module
- [ ] Ensure modularity and maintainability (AC: 5)
- [ ] Integrate logging and monitoring (AC: 7)
- [ ] Add automated tests (unit, integration, E2E) (AC: 7)
- [ ] Validate compatibility with university infrastructure (AC: 6)

## Dev Notes
- Source Tree: See backend/ and frontend/ directories for current structure.
- All code must follow modular monolith and event-driven patterns as described in architecture docs.
- Use Docker Compose for orchestration and deployment.
- Preserve all REST and WebSocket API endpoints for major modules.
- Exclude authentication (to be handled in a separate story).

### Testing
- Test files should be located alongside implementation files (e.g., __tests__ folders or *.spec.ts).
- Use Jest for backend (NestJS) and React Testing Library for frontend.
- Include unit, integration, and E2E tests for all major modules.
- Ensure tests cover all acceptance criteria and integration points.
